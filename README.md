# SQL_bike_project
#This was my Google data analytics certificate program capstone project. The goal was to analyze bikeshare data in Chicago from the previous year and come up with ideas to increase annual membership over casual membership, specifically by targeting current casual riders for membership. My analysis was to focus on how members and casual riders use the bikeshare service differently. The data was already cleaned and ready to use and it was provided as part of the certificate program. 

I wanted to get an idea of the habits of the different rider types. To that end, I wanted to start by figuring out what the average bike ride length was across all months, and then see if there was A) variability across months and B) variability between members and casual riders. The shortest ride length corresponded to the coldest months (January and February). Overall the average ride lenth was 15.5 minutes, with members averaging shorter rides (11.8 minutes) and casual riders averaging longer rides (22.1 minutes). 

Next, I wanted to know if there was an overall difference in average ride length per month (B), and also, if there was a difference in rider type across months (C). Finally, I wanted to see which bikeshare start and end stations where most popular with which rider type (D). I limited to the top 5 most popular stations for each rider type. The goal being to test out any new marketing initiative at these five stations before expanding further. 

At this point, I dove deeper into the data to see what trends emerged on different days of the week. For example, I wanted to know if there were more casual riders during weekdays or weekends, and also what times of day (morning, afternoon, evening) were the most popular. 

I would have liked to have more specific information about identifying repeat casual riders, so these users could be more accurately targeted. Depending on hoy many times a month they are riding, it could be easy to convince these casual riders that a membership is the more logical and economical option. They could also use the service more often and for shorter trips at their convenience.
